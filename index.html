I have done the same on my Hello Apk Website. Here, we first use the get_field() function to retrieve the values of the ACF fields we want to display. We assign each field value to a variable, such as $my_field1, $my_field2, and $my_field3.

Then, we use a series of if statements to check if each field has a value. If it does, we use the echo function to output the value wrapped in

tags.

You can customize this code to fit your specific needs by changing the field names and HTML output. This code assumes that you're using ACF fields on product pages in a WordPress site.
