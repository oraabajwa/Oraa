I have done the same on my <a href= "https://helloapk.net/">Hello Apk</a> Website. 
Here, we first use the get_field() function to retrieve the values of the ACF fields we want to display. We assign each field value to a variable, such as $my_field1, $my_field2, and $my_field3.

Then, we use a series of if statements to check if each field <a href="https://github.com/oraabajwa/Oraa">has</a> a value. If it does, we use the echo function to output the value wrapped in <p> tags.

You can customize  <a href= "https://threads-downloader.net/">this</a> code to fit your specific needs by changing the field names and HTML output. This code assumes that you're using ACF fields on product pages in a WordPress site.
